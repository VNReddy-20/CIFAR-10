# CIFAR - 10

This is a Project about Image Classification of 10 different types of images.

### Domain :- Deep Learning with CNN (Convlolution Neural Networks)

This project contains 2 datasets - 1. Trained & 2. Testing.
For the input process testing dataset pushes a random image from its dataset by reducing the image pixels by 36x36 to make the image looks like blurred image.
Then the input moves through the CNN and Pooling layers for the process. After the image processing the in the input process then the trained dataset matches the input image and figure out whats the image is and then gives the output what the image is.

This project is running and gives output. But it takes a little bit long time for the image processing to produce the output. May be later on working this project, i will try to reduce the processing time for the output and optimizes the code for better accuracy.
